## 2025-07-24 - Initial Testing
Prompt Version: v1 (no hash yet)
Module Tested: packages/termtap/src/termtap/tmux

### What Worked
- Correctly applied underscore prefixes to internal functions
- Updated all references across multiple files
- Applied comprehensive docstring templates
- Simplified module docstrings to only show PUBLIC API
- Fixed method naming (SessionInfo.from_format_line)

### What Failed
- Still imports internal functions in `__init__.py` despite explicit instructions
- Creates ruff F401 "unused import" errors

### Root Cause
- Prompt preserves existing internal imports when they're already present
- Being too conservative about removing existing code
- Conflict between documenting internal APIs and Python import conventions

### Recommendations
- Keep prompt focused on naming conventions only
- Handle import cleanliness as separate step (manual or ruff)
- Consider adding prompt hash for version tracking
- Document that `__init__.py` should only contain PUBLIC API imports
